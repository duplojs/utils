# API Reference

Welcome to the API reference for `@duplojs/utils`. This section presents all available functions, organized by data type.

## [🛠️ Common](/en/v1/api/common/)
Cross-cutting utilities and generic helpers usable with any data type: pipes, composition, identity, and more.

## [📋 Array](/en/v1/api/array/)
Complete collection of functions to manipulate arrays: `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `sort`, and advanced operations like `partition` or `chunk`.

## [🏢 Clean](/en/v1/api/clean/)
Core building blocks of Clean Architecture: creation of business entities, business types (`NewType`), use cases.

## [📊 DataParser](/en/v1/api/dataParser/)
Tools to parse and validate incoming data. Transform raw data into typed structures with custom validation rules.

## [🕦 Date](/en/v1/api/date/)
Immutable date/time API with `TheDate` (date object), `TheTime` (duration), and their serialized formats. Includes creation, formatting, time operations, comparisons, and timezone handling.

## [🔀 Either](/en/v1/api/either/)
Either monad for functional error handling. Avoid exceptions and manage success/error results explicitly and type-safely.

## [⚡ Generator](/en/v1/api/generator/)
Utility functions to work with generators and create lazy sequences. Ideal for efficiently handling large amounts of data.

## [🔤 String](/en/v1/api/string/)
Functions to manipulate strings immutably. Find operations like `capitalize`, `trim`, `split`, `replace`, and much more.

## [🔢 Number](/en/v1/api/number/)
Utilities to work with numbers: math operations, formatting, validation, conversions, and advanced calculations.

## [📦 Object](/en/v1/api/object/)
Deep object manipulation: property transformations, merging, cloning, validation, and safe access to nested values.

## [🎯 Pattern](/en/v1/api/pattern/)
Powerful pattern matching system for TypeScript. Create complex conditions, handle union types, and write declarative, type-safe code.
