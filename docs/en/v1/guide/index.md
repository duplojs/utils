# Introduction
`@duplojs/utils` is a core building block of the DuploJS ecosystem. It reflects our vision of TypeScript development: an approach focused on robustness, readability, and high-quality typing.

TypeScript is now essential to JavaScript, but native API types were often designed to ease the transition from existing JS code. As a result, many basic functions and methods expose signatures that are too broad or imprecise, which makes code less safe.

Many libraries try to fill these gaps, but that often multiplies a project's dependencies. `@duplojs/utils` brings these essential building blocks together in one place, with a clear philosophy: functional programming, immutability, and compatibility with a `pipe` system.

The goal of the DuploJS ecosystem is to provide robust, DX-oriented tools so you don't waste time on problems that should be simple day to day.
